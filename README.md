This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: attempting to use a file that is not present in the build context. The initial `Dockerfile` is flawed; the `COPY requirements.txt .` instruction fails because the `requirements.txt` file is missing.  The corrected `Dockerfile_fixed` demonstrates a proper fix.
